# Purpose

After about 4 months of deliberation over various network policy user stories, the Sig-network network-policy subgroup (retroactively formed in July of 2020) decided that it was time to 

- start looking at how the networkpolicy api could be improved by actively designing changes against it
- create a combination of hacking on KEP-like docs and possibly CRD(s)
- while formulating an overall strategy to tie those docs together

So, although we all know that this work may not get instantly accepted into sig-network and will require iteration and so on, I think the overall direction of the group is *its time to try to make some forward progress, in spite of the ambiguous future*.

PLEASE MAKE A PR TO THIS REPO WITH YOUR GITHUB ID AND COMPANY FOR TRACKING PURPOSES so we can get started!
