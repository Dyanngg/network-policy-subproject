# policy ++ wg artifacts

A starter repo to donate to Kubernetes-sigs so the community can own and iterate on stories over time, with issue tracking, as we close out the policy++ wg.  The ultimate goal of this repo is to make concrete proposals that can be integrated into a series of KEPs, demos, and walkthroughs that will benefit the overall SIG.

# Background

Between April 28 - > August 13th of 2020, folks from 10 companies or so met once a week to discuss policies that they had wanted, heard about, or envisoned.  These included things like:

- node aware policies for controlling access to node-host services
- better metadata for targetting policies against services
- explicit deny, allow, logging policies for better administrative management
- being able to define policies as service level constructs, rather then pod constructs

The purpose of this repo is to codify each of these stories as a more formal document that we can move forward with to create a more structured and information-dense set of asks to the SIG-network group for newer network policy APIs.
